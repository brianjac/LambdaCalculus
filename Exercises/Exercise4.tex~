\section{Problem Statement}
\textbf{(i)} Suppose that we have colored some of the redexes in $X$ green and we have a colored reduction $X \twoheadrightarrow_\beta Y$. Let $R$ be a green redex in $X$; show that no residual of $R$ is a subterm of another residual of $R$ (we say they are not "nested") in $Y$.[Hint; use the existence of a valuation on $X$; the value of any free variable of $R$ must be less than the value of $R$]\\

\textbf{(ii)} Show that in a colored reduction all the alpha conversions can be done at the beginning. Is this true for all reductions?
