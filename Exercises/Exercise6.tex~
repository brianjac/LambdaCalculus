\section{Problem Statement}
Recall that we can reduce potentials in two ways:\\

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item $(U^{a,n+1,n+2} V^{b,n+1})^{n+1,c}$ reduces to\\
        $(U^{a,n+1} V^{b,n+1,n})^{n,n+1,c}$
  \item $(U^{a,n+2,n+1} V^{b,n})^{n,c}$ reduces to\\
        $(U^{a,n+2} V^{b,n,n+1})^{n+1,n,c}$
\end{enumerate}

Show that every sequence of such reductions must terminate. [Hint; given a term $X$ with potential, ignore lambdas to think of $X$ as a binary tree with sequences of non-negative integers at its nodes. Let $b$ be a positive integer bigger than the sum of all the previously mentioned integers $+ 3$. For a given subterm $Y$ of $X$ we have the potential $n_{1},...,n_{k}$ and the number of moves $m$ to the left in the path from the root of $X$ to $Y$. So for example in $(\l x.xx)(\l x.xx)$, where we have omitted potentials, the $m$ for the 1st occurrence of $x$ is $2$, for the second occurrence of $x$ is $1$, for the third is $1$, and for the 4th is $0$. Now to this subterm of $X$ assign the value $(n_{1}+...+n_{k}) * b^{m}$ and let $\#X$ be the sum of the values of the subterms of $X$. Show that potential reductions reduce $\#X$]
